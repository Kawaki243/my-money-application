## ⚙️ How the Project Works
Here’s the flow of how **My Money Application** operates:

1. **User Interaction (Frontend)**  
   - The user logs in, adds expenses, sets budgets, or views reports via the **React (Vite) frontend**.  
   - Authentication requests are sent to the backend using **JWT tokens**.  

2. **Backend Processing (Spring Boot)**  
   - The backend validates requests (authentication, authorization).  
   - API endpoints handle CRUD operations for **users, income, expenses, and budgets**.  
   - Data is processed, validated, and stored in the **database**.  

3. **Database Layer**  
   - All financial data is stored in a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL/MySQL).  
   - Transactions, categories, users, and budget data are linked via schemas.  

4. **Data Visualization & Reports**  
   - The backend provides data to the frontend.  
   - The React frontend uses **Chart.js** (or similar) to render interactive graphs.  
   - Users can **export data** to Excel or receive **email reports** generated by the backend.  

5. **Deployment (Optional)**  
   - Using **Docker & docker-compose**, both frontend and backend can be containerized.  
   - This ensures consistent deployment across environments.
